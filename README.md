Comment-Garuda
==============

Comment-Garuda, the latest ware in our well-known Garuda suite of OpenQNL based applications, is designed to make the experience of "internet comments" more pleasant and user-friendly. Unlike legacy and proprietary applications designed to "ban" or "ignore" individual "trolls" within social media settings or comment threads, Comment-Garuda uses quasistochastic hermeneutics to identify problem comments before they reach your "web browsing device." Via heuristic analysis and database integration, Comment-Garuda identifies "trolling" and "disgusting, misogynistic, violent or hateful comments" and ports them to the Outer Darkness, where they will spend eternity writhing in agony to the sound of the shrill, uncanny piping of the servitors of the Crawling Chaos. 

Don't ignore your trolls. Let Comment-Garuda ignore the trolls for you!
